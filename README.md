# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Decision-Tree


**Problem Statement**

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis of diabetes can help healthcare professionals take preventive measures and provide timely treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and expensive, making it crucial to develop automated and efficient prediction models. This project aims to build machine learning models using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms to predict diabetes based on medical and demographic data. By comparing these models, we can determine which approach provides better accuracy and reliability in predicting diabetes.

**Overview**

This project explores the effectiveness of two machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression and Decision Tree—for predicting diabetes. The dataset consists of various medical and demographic features such as:

Age
Gender
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Hypertension
Heart Disease
Smoking History
Blood Glucose Level

The models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions and correlations.
Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
Performance Comparison: Evaluating models using various classification metrics.
Insights and Interpretability: Analyzing feature importance and decision-making processes.


**Technologies Used**

Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)



**Usage**

Load Dataset: The dataset should be in CSV format and loaded using Pandas.
Preprocess Data: Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical data.
Train Models: Implement and train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
Evaluate Performance: Compare the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Make Predictions: Use the trained models to predict diabetes in new patient records.
